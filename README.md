## Project structure

The browser extension is built with [WXT](https://wxt.dev/) and React. One
codebase produces both the Chrome (MV3) and Firefox (MV2) builds — there is no
longer a separate source tree per browser.

```
/wxt                        - Browser extension (WXT + React + TypeScript)
  /entrypoints
    background.ts           - Background service worker entry
    /background             - Daily rewards, scheduling, search runner
    rewards.content.ts      - Content script on rewards.bing.com
    bingResult.content.ts   - Content script on Bing search results
    /popup                  - Popup UI (React)
    /components             - Shared React components
    /hooks                  - React hooks (storage, search progress)
    /utils                  - Search, progress, settings, helpers
    /data                   - Search term pool
    /enums, /types          - Shared TypeScript definitions
  /public                   - Static assets copied into the build (icons)
  wxt.config.ts             - Manifest and build configuration
/microsoft_rewards_app      - Android app (Flutter)
/assets                     - Source icon artwork (icon.svg)
/scripts                    - Maintenance scripts (icon rasterization)
/docs                       - Documentation and README images
```

## Development

All extension commands run from the `wxt` directory:

```bash
cd wxt
npm install

npm run dev              # Chrome, hot reload
npm run dev:firefox      # Firefox, hot reload

npm run compile          # TypeScript typecheck
npm run test             # Unit tests (Vitest)

npm run build            # Production build -> wxt/dist/chrome-mv3
npm run build:firefox    # Production build -> wxt/dist/firefox-mv2
npm run zip              # Packaged zip for store upload
npm run zip:firefox
```

Build output lives in `wxt/dist` and is **not** committed — releases are
published to the web stores and to GitHub Releases.

To load an unpacked development build: run `npm run build`, then in Chrome open
`chrome://extensions`, enable Developer mode, and "Load unpacked" from
`wxt/dist/chrome-mv3`.

### Legacy code

Versions before the WXT rewrite used hand-written `chrome/` and `firefox/`
source trees with committed compiled output. That code has been removed from
the default branch and preserved on the [`legacy`](https://github.com/spin311/MicrosoftRewardsWebsite/tree/legacy)
branch. Nothing on the default branch depends on it.
